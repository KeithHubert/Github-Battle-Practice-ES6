# Github-Battle-Practice

This is a React one page app that allows users to "battle" to see who has the most Github points. 

For this project I built Webpack from scratch. I learned about reusable components, props, pure functions, proptypes, 
the "this" keyword, state and stateless functional components, React lifecycles, Ajax Requests, React Router, forms
and encapsulation, dynamic rendering, query params, Axios, promises, external API, props.children, default props, .reduce,
.map, and .filter.

My finished project can be seen below:
